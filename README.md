# vagrant-to-local
Make your Vagrant boxes easily accessible for local applications.

=======
# Introduction:
This script copies the local Vagrant box VM details to your ~/.ssh/config file so they can be accessed by applications locally on your machine such as Ansible. This script works on Linux and Mac only.

# Usage:
Change to a Vagrant directory and run the script. 

# Notes:
1) Running the script in another Vagrant directory will remove your current mappings and replace them with the ones in your current directory.

2) Do not place any additional configuration between the markers generated by this script. It will be over-written.
